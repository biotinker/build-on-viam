# Build on Viam: Hackathon Announcement + Updated 20% Time Program

Deep platform familiarity isn't optional — it's what makes us effective. When you deeply understand Viam, you make better product and implementation decisions day-to-day. You can evaluate tradeoffs, spot issues early, and drive the right approach in your own work. You also move faster with less time lost to unfamiliar territory and dead ends. This program pays back in both autonomy and velocity.

## The Projects

The program is built around a set of well-defined robotics applications that we'll develop over the coming months, starting with a hackathon kickoff. Each project has clear goals, exercises key Viam capabilities, and has a backlog that extends beyond the hackathon. We welcome proposals for additional well-defined projects that exercise many of Viam's capabilities. Links to browse the list of projects and submit proposals are below.

## What's changing with 20% time?

We're adding more structure and support. Every engineer will join a project team for the quarter, dedicating at least 4 hours per week. We'll kick off with a 3-day hackathon, followed by bi-weekly demos and regular syncs throughout the quarter. Enablement sessions on using AI more effectively, robotics fundamentals, platform capabilities, and best practices will be available as needed.

## Hackathon Kickoff: February 24-26

| Day | Schedule |
| :---- | :---- |
| Feb 24 | 9am Breakfast, 10am Kickoff, 11am-12pm Exec Office Hours, 12:30pm Lunch, 2pm-4pm Exec Office Hours |
| Feb 25 | 9am Breakfast, 10am-11am Exec Office Hours, 12pm Lunch, 2pm-4pm Exec Office Hours |
| Feb 26 | 9am Breakfast, 10am-12:30pm Exec Office Hours, 12:30pm Lunch, 1pm-3pm Final Touches, 4pm Presentations to Judges |

Remote employees can participate virtually. The Greenhouse and Retro Roomba projects are specifically designed to be remote-friendly. We'll send you the hardware you need.

## Key Dates

* Feb 6 — Deadline to submit new project proposals
* Feb 13 — Deadline to join a project team
* Week of Feb 16 — Pre-hackathon meetings to finalize MVP strategy
* Feb 24-26 — Hackathon

## A Note on Expectations

From Emily: Knowing the Viam platform is a core expectation of performance at Viam. As part of our performance expectations, every engineer is to actively use, explore, and deepen their understanding of the platform. The upcoming hackathon will kick-start this focus, but ongoing hands-on usage and continuous learning are required, not optional, to be effective in our roles and to execute well as a company. These expectations will be formally reflected in the engineering career ladder in the coming weeks.

## View Projects & Join a Team (actions for you)

**1.** Browse the current [project list](https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/README.md).

To propose a new project, see the guidelines at the bottom of the [projects README](https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/README.md#proposing-new-projects).

The build team and I will assemble the hardware and configure Viam machines before the hackathon. You won't need to assemble and configure hardware from scratch. For the projects where there is lots of interest, we'll create multiple builds and establish multiple teams.

**2.** Select the project you want to join – add your name to the corresponding row in the [project team doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbU6BM_wMc3zNSto8v5F64fB3vbTYfGM_7teNfQeQDw/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

**3.** Complete the [T-shirt order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMA2Dbfj1PhCeY4t_8W9rGMTy5vHHzxx43_MW4R7vzzYc7Tg/viewform).

## Questions?

See the [FAQ](https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/FAQ.md) for answers to common questions. Slack me with anything else.

Looking forward to building together!
