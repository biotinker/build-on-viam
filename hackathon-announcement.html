<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Build on Viam: Hackathon Announcement + Updated 20% Time Program</h1>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>As mentioned at the recent all-hands, we're launching <b>Build on Viam</b> — a program where we become our own best customers by building real robotics applications on the Viam platform.</p>

<p>Deep platform familiarity isn't optional — it's what enables us to work faster and more effectively. Every hour spent navigating unfamiliar parts of the platform, debugging issues we could have anticipated, or going down dead-end paths is time we're not shipping new features or user experience improvements. This program is an investment that pays back in velocity: engineers who deeply understand Viam make better decisions, move faster, and build better products.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">The Projects</h2>

<p>The program is built around a set of well-defined robotics applications that we'll develop over the coming months, starting with a hackathon kickoff. Each project has clear goals, exercises key Viam capabilities, and has a backlog that extends beyond the hackathon. We welcome proposals for additional well-defined projects that exercise many of Viam's capabilities — links to browse the list of projects and submit proposals are below.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">What's changing with 20% time?</h2>

<p>We're adding more structure and support. Every engineer will join a project team for the quarter, dedicating at least 4 hours per week. We'll kick off with a 3-day hackathon, followed by bi-weekly demos and regular syncs throughout the quarter. Enablement sessions on using AI more effectively, robotics fundamentals, platform capabilities, and best practices will be available as needed.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Hackathon Kickoff: February 24-26</h2>

<p>We're kicking off the program with a hackathon!</p>

<p>Remote employees can participate virtually. The <b>Greenhouse</b> and <b>Retro Roomba</b> projects are specifically designed to be remote-friendly. We'll send you the hardware you need.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Key Dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Feb 6</b> — Deadline to submit new project proposals</li>
  <li><b>Feb 13</b> — Deadline to join a project team</li>
  <li><b>Week of Feb 16</b> — Pre-hackathon meetings to finalize MVP strategy and enablement needs</li>
  <li><b>Feb 24-26</b> — Hackathon</li>
</ul>

<p>To propose a new project, submit a pull request with a new project description file following the <a href="https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/project-template.md">project template</a>. See the guidelines at the bottom of the <a href="https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/README.md">projects README</a>.</p>

<p>The build team and I will assemble the hardware and configure Viam machines before the hackathon — you won't need to build hardware from scratch. For the projects where there is lots of interest, we'll create multiple builds and establish multiple teams.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">A Note on Expectations</h2>

<p>From Emily: Knowing the Viam platform is a core expectation of performance at Viam. As part of our performance expectations, every engineer is to actively use, explore, and deepen their understanding of the platform. The upcoming hackathon will kick-start this focus, but ongoing hands-on usage and continuous learning are required, not optional, to be effective in our roles and to execute well as a company. These expectations will be formally reflected in the engineering career ladder in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/shannonbradshaw/build-on-viam/blob/main/projects/FAQ.md">FAQ</a> for answers to common questions. Slack me with anything else.</p>

<p>Looking forward to building together!</p>

<p>Shannon</p>
